# Support safety & scam avoidance

--8<-- "_includes/safety-banner.md"

This knowledgebase assumes a hostile environment: scammers will target people asking for help.

## Golden rules

1. **No DMs.** If someone DMs you “support”, treat it as a scam attempt. [^tg-2024-12-25-2010662]
2. **Never share secrets.** Seed phrases, private keys, `wallet.dat`, remote-desktop access.
3. **Verify links.** Use redd.love / reddcoin.com / download.reddcoin.com as your starting points.
4. **Ask in public channels.** You get collective validation and scammers have less room to manipulate.

## Why we say this

Admin guidance in the Telegram channel repeatedly warns users not to talk privately when troubleshooting forks/sync issues. [^tg-2024-12-25-2010662]
