# Support scams & safety

Crypto support channels are heavily targeted by scammers. This page documents common patterns seen in ReddCoin support channels and how to protect yourself.

!!! danger "Never share secrets"
    Never share your **seed phrase**, **private keys**, or your full **wallet.dat** with anyone.

## Red flags

- Someone DMs you claiming to be “support”
- They ask you to “validate” your wallet by entering your seed phrase on a website
- They ask you to import a private key into a tool you didn’t verify
- They pressure you with urgency (“act now”)

## Admin guidance seen in the public channel

> Be careful with scammers who send private messages.
Don't talk with anyone in private.
Scammers can impersonate people copying their name and the logo picture.

## Safe way to get help

1. Ask questions **in public** (group chat), not DMs.
2. Share only non-sensitive info (wallet version, OS, error text).
3. Use **official links** from: https://linktr.ee/reddcoin
4. When moving funds, do a **small test transaction** first.

## If you think you were compromised

- Move any remaining funds to a fresh wallet you control.
- Rotate passwords on email/exchange accounts.
- Consider a clean OS reinstall if malware is suspected.
