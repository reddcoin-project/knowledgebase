title: Self-custody & private key management (The Redd Way)
---

Self-custody is a core part of “old school crypto” and aligns with ReddCoin’s values: **transparency, ethics, and user empowerment**.

## The non-negotiables

- **You control your keys.**
- **Backups are your responsibility.**
- **If you lose keys, nobody can reverse it.**

## Practical rules for ReddHeads

1. Keep a backup of your wallet/keys **offline**
2. Use strong OS hygiene:
   - updated OS
   - reputable antivirus (if applicable)
   - full-disk encryption
3. Never copy/paste secrets into chat apps
4. Test restores (at least once) with small amounts

## Exchanges vs self-custody

Exchanges are useful for trading, but they are not wallets. If you’re here to *use* RDD (tip, stake, participate), self-custody is the default.
