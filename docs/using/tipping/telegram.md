title: Tipping in Telegram
---

Telegram support is referenced on the official ReddBot product page, and Telegram bot implementations often expose a built-in command list.

    Telegram implementations may differ by bot instance. Use the bot’s built-in **/commands** list to confirm the exact syntax.

## Quick start

1. Open the ReddCoin official community group (if you’re not sure where to start): https://t.me/ReddcoinOfficial  
   (Community index reference: https://wiki.reddcoin.com/Community)
2. Find the bot instructions in the group (or the pinned messages, if present).
3. In a chat with the bot, run:

```
/help
```

or:

```
/commands
```

A public Telegram bot implementation notes `/balance`, `/price`, `/help`, and `/commands` as common entry points.

## Safety notes

- Treat bot balances as “spending money”.
- Withdraw larger amounts to your own wallet for self-custody.
