title: Tipping on Reddit
---

ReddCoin has had Reddit tipping support over time. The ReddCoin Wiki’s community index points to the Reddit tip bot account:

- Tip bot account: https://www.reddit.com/user/tipReddCoin  
  (Reference: https://wiki.reddcoin.com/Community)

!!! info "Last verified: 2026-02-13"
    Reddit bot behavior can change (API policy, subreddit permissions). Start by visiting the bot profile and checking recent instructions.

## Quick start (safe, minimal)

1. Visit the bot account and read any current pinned instructions:
   https://www.reddit.com/user/tipReddCoin
2. If the bot accepts private messages, start by requesting your info / balance (often called `+info` in historical ReddCoin tipbots).  
3. Send a **small test tip** before relying on it.

## If you need “legacy” command references

Older ReddCoin tipbot workflows often used `+register` / `+info` patterns (similar to the Twitter/Twitch guides). For troubleshooting context, the legacy wiki includes general tipping FAQs and troubleshooting notes:

## Safety

- Use Reddit bots for tipping, not long-term storage.
- Withdraw meaningful amounts to self-custody.
