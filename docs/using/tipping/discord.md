title: Tipping in Discord
---

The official ReddBot page lists Discord as a supported social platform for tipping, and notes that bots can be integrated into Discord chat groups.

    Discord bot commands vary by configuration (prefix, slash commands). Always start with the bot’s built-in help.

## Quick start

1. Join the official ReddCoin Discord (and ask in the right channel for current bot usage):
   https://www.reddcoin.com/reddcoin-4-22-0-entering-open-beta-testing/ (includes Discord reference)
2. In the server where the bot is installed, try one of:
   - `/help`
   - `!help`
   - or ask a moderator what the command prefix is

## Common flow (conceptual)

- Create/register wallet (if required)
- Deposit
- Tip
- Withdraw

If the bot exposes a “commands” list, treat that as the source of truth for the current syntax.

## Safety

Discord bots are convenient for tipping — but treat them as a hot wallet.
