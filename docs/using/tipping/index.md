title: Social tipping (ReddBot)
---

ReddCoin is built for **social-first value transfer**. For many ReddHeads, the easiest way to tip and receive tips on social platforms is **ReddBot**.

    Platform support can change due to third‑party API policies. If something below doesn’t match what you see in practice, please report it so volunteers can update the guide.

**Official ReddBot page:** https://www.reddcoin.com/reddbot/

## Quick start (works everywhere)

1. Find the bot on your platform (Twitter/X, Twitch, Telegram, Reddit, Discord).
2. Use the platform’s **help** command (or “commands” list) to confirm the current syntax.
3. Start small (a tiny test tip) before moving larger amounts.

## Safety: use ReddBot like a “hot wallet”
ReddBot wallets are designed for small social transactions. Don’t store long-term savings there.

- Keep larger balances in your own self-custody wallet (see: **Self-custody → The Redd Way**).
- Tip bots can change, go offline, or be affected by platform policy changes.
- If you receive a large tip, **withdraw to your own wallet**.
