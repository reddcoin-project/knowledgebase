title: Social tipping (ReddBot)
---

ReddCoin is built for **social-first value transfer**. The simplest way for most ReddHeads to tip on social platforms is via **ReddBot**.

## Where tipping is supported

ReddBot has supported multiple platforms over time (e.g., Twitter/X, Reddit, Twitch, Telegram, Discord). Platform availability can change with third-party API policies, so always confirm via the official ReddBot page.

## Safety & etiquette (The Redd Way)

- Tip from self-custody when possible.
- Start small when testing a new platform integration.
- Avoid sharing private keys or wallet files with anyone.

If you’re building tipping into an app:
- Keep keys client-side or in a hardened signer
- Prefer minimal permissions
- Log only what you need (privacy-first)
