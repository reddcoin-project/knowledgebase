# Namespaces

ReddID is designed to support **multiple identity namespaces** (think: `@name@twitter`, `@name@tiktok`, `@name@reddit`, etc.) while keeping the underlying ownership, auctions, and renewal rules enforceable on-chain.

This section curates the Namespace documents from the ReddCoin GitHub wiki into a builder‑ready view.

## Core idea

A **two-tier market**:

1. **Top-level namespaces** are auctioned first (e.g., `twitter`, `reddit`, `youtube`).
2. The **namespace owner** defines the rules and economic parameters for user IDs within that namespace, and receives a share of the revenue generated by user ID auctions.

## Namespace ID rules (top-level)

Namespace IDs have explicit format constraints (length and allowed characters) and are intended to be globally unique across the system.

## Auction lifecycle (high level)

A namespace auction has a defined lifecycle:

- Create auction (with configuration parameters)
- Auction open (bids)
- Auction ends (finalize winner)
- Namespace becomes active (renewal required over time; configuration updates possible)

Anti-sniping and deposit requirements are used to discourage low-effort squatting.

## Configuration parameters (what a namespace controls)

A namespace can define:

- Allowed characters for user IDs (numbers, hyphens, underscores)
- Min/max ID length
- Auction duration bounds and bid increment rules
- Renewal / grace periods
- Revenue distribution percentages (namespace owner / burn / nodes / dev fund)
- Pricing tiers by name length (e.g., 1–2 chars premium)

These parameters are hashed for integrity and propagated so that validation is consistent across nodes.

## Builder checklist

If you’re implementing or integrating Namespaces:

- [ ] Implement namespace validation (format + uniqueness)
- [ ] Store/propagate namespace configuration (hash + update rules)
- [ ] Enforce auction rules (deposit %, min increments, anti-sniping windows)
- [ ] Handle settlement (winner assignment + revenue distribution + refunds)
- [ ] Track expiration/renewal and grace periods
- [ ] Expose wallet UI: browse, bid, manage namespace configuration, renew
