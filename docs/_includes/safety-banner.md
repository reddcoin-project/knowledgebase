!!! danger "Support safety (read this first)"

    - **Admins/devs will not DM you first.** Keep support conversations **public** (Telegram group / GitHub issues).
    - **Never share** your seed phrase, private keys, or `wallet.dat` with anyone.
    - Use only **official download links** (reddcoin.com / redd.love / download.reddcoin.com). Beware look‑alike sites.
    - If someone asks you to “verify” by sending coins, installing remote-control software, or sharing secrets (seed/private key), **it’s a scam**.
    - When sharing logs/screenshots publicly, **redact personal info** (paths, IPs, usernames). Do **not** redact block hashes needed for fork checks.
