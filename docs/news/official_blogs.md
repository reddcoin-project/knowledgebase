# Official blogs & publications

This project has published over time across multiple sites. Some older posts are still valuable background, but may not reflect current wallet versions.

## Primary / current

- WordPress news feed (releases, announcements): https://wordpress.reddcoin.com/index.php/news/
- ReddWallet downloads page: https://www.reddcoin.com/reddwallet/
- Redd.Love blog: https://blog.redd.love/

## Long-form / archival

- ReddCoin “ReddBlog” (older long-form posts): https://www.reddcoin.com/reddblog/
- TechAdept on Medium (historical context + strategy): https://techadept.medium.com/
- ProjectRedd publication on Medium (technical announcements): https://medium.com/projectredd

## Recommended approach

1. Use **WordPress News** + **download.reddcoin.com** for “what’s current”.
2. Use **blog.redd.love / Medium** for background + narrative.
3. Treat older ReddBlog articles as **context**, and cross-check any operational steps against current wallet docs.
