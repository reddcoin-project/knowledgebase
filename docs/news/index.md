# News & updates (curated)

This section links to **official announcements, release writeups, and high-signal community updates**.

!!! note "Why this exists"
    ReddCoin has content spread across multiple sites over many years. This hub provides a **single, curated** entry point, while avoiding spam and low-signal reposts.

## Start here

- **Wallet releases & changelog hub:** [Releases](releases.md)
- **Official blogs & Medium index:** [Official publications](official-publications.md)

## Reliability notes

- Older posts can be accurate historically but outdated operationally.
- Always prefer **current Core version guidance** and the **version-aware troubleshooting runbooks** in [Using RDD → Troubleshooting](../using/troubleshooting/index.md).
