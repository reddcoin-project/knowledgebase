# Proof‑of‑Stake Velocity (PoSV) — Technical Deep Dive

PoSV differs from standard Proof‑of‑Stake in that it rewards both:

1. Coin age / balance participation
2. Transaction activity / velocity

## Goals of PoSV

- Encourage circulation rather than hoarding
- Reward social tipping behavior
- Keep staking accessible on consumer hardware
- Prevent wealth centralization from purely passive holding

## PoSV v2 Improvements

- Better resistance to grinding attacks
- Improved fairness of stake selection
- More predictable staking intervals
- Compatibility with modern wallet versions

## Operational implications

For node operators:
- uptime matters
- wallet unlock policy matters
- regular usage can influence rewards

For casual users:
- staking works best when wallet stays online
- small activity is not harmful to staking chances
