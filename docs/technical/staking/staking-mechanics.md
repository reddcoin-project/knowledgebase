# Staking Mechanics Explained

This guide explains how staking actually works in practice.

## What influences staking

- wallet uptime
- coin age
- network participation
- overall staking pool size

## What does NOT matter

- expensive hardware
- constant high transaction volume
- running multiple wallets unnecessarily

## Expected reward behavior

Staking is probabilistic.

That means:
- rewards may appear irregular
- small wallets may wait longer
- rewards depend on total network weight

## Best practices

- keep wallet online as much as possible
- avoid moving coins constantly
- keep software updated
- monitor peers and block height

## Common myths

**“If I don’t stake daily something is wrong.”**
False — randomness is normal.

**“Moving coins resets everything permanently.”**
Not permanently, but it can reset coin age.
