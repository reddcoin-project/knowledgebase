This knowledgebase is maintained for **ReddHeads** by a volunteer team. We keep our work public so anyone can verify what’s happening and contribute.

## Where to track active work

- GitHub org: https://github.com/reddcoin-project/
- Core repo (code): https://github.com/reddcoin-project/reddcoin/
- Knowledgebase repo: https://github.com/reddcoin-project/knowledgebase/  *(if different, update this link in mkdocs.yml repo_url)*
- Issues (what needs help): https://github.com/reddcoin-project/reddcoin/issues
- Releases (what shipped): https://github.com/reddcoin-project/reddcoin/releases

## Volunteer progress (how to interpret)

- **Open issues** = known work items.
- **Pull requests** = work in flight.
- **Releases** = production milestones.
- **Docs updates** = community-first usability improvements.
