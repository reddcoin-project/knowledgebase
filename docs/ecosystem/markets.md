    External links can change over time. If something looks outdated, please report it.

    Treat listings and availability as informational only. Always do a small test transaction first.



!!! warning "Safety: exchanges are high-risk"

    Exchange support, wallet maintenance, and deposit/withdraw availability can change without notice.
    Always do a **small test deposit/withdrawal** first, and never leave long-term holdings on an exchange.

This page is designed to be **operationally safe**:

- It does **not** recommend trading or predict price.
- It focuses on whether venues are real, reachable, and whether **RDD deposits/withdrawals** function.
- Every venue entry should include a **Last verified** date.

## Status vocabulary

- **Trading only**: you can trade, but deposits/withdrawals may be disabled.
- **Deposits OK**: deposits confirmed working recently.
- **Withdrawals OK**: withdrawals confirmed working recently.
- **Operational**: trading + deposits + withdrawals confirmed.

## Verification rubric (minimum)

Before sending funds to an exchange or custodian, verify **at least**:

1. **Domain authenticity**: correct domain, HTTPS, no look‑alike spelling.
2. **RDD network status**: check for wallet maintenance notices.
3. **Chain correctness**: confirm you are on the canonical chain (see: Reference → Canonical chain verification).
4. **Test transaction**: send a small amount first, confirm deposit + withdrawal.

## Exchange matrix (curated)

> This is a **curated, community-maintained** matrix. Always verify live status before moving funds.

| Venue | Trading | Deposits | Withdrawals | Notes | Last verified |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| (Add venue) |  |  |  |  |  |

## Market aggregators (read-only)

Aggregators are useful to discover venues, but **do not guarantee** that deposits/withdrawals work.
