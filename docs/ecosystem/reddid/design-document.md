# ReddID Design Document (curated)

This is a curated, knowledgebase-friendly summary of the **Comprehensive Design Document ReddID (v3.1, April 2025)**, with direct links back to the canonical wiki page. citeturn0view1

## One-paragraph summary

The document proposes an integrated identity and naming system built on ReddCoin that allocates human-readable identifiers using a two-tier auction model (namespaces and user IDs), plus a cross-namespace profile layer (“ReddIDs”) that links identities across namespaces. citeturn0view1

## Core structure

### Three-tier model

1. **Namespaces (top level)** — e.g., `.redd`, `.crypto`, etc.; auctioned first, and then namespace owners define rules/economic parameters. citeturn0view1  
2. **User IDs (second level)** — identifiers inside a namespace (e.g., `alice.redd`); auctioned with namespace-specific rules. citeturn0view1  
3. **ReddIDs (cross-namespace identity)** — profiles that connect multiple IDs across namespaces; described as direct registration rather than auctions. citeturn0view1  

### Design goals called out

The design explicitly highlights:
- market-driven price discovery for valuable IDs/namespaces,
- anti-squatting via economic disincentives,
- deflationary pressure on RDD supply,
- sustainable funding and fee distribution,
- and a reputation/identity layer across the ecosystem. citeturn0view1
