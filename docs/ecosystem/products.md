## ReddCoin (RDD)

ReddCoin is the “social digital currency” focused on tipping, donating, and rewarding creators and communities. Price discovery happens on third‑party exchanges; the team does not control exchange pricing, and CoinGecko is suggested for a realistic view of market price. citeturn2view0
