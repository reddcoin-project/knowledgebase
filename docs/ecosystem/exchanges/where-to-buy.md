# Where to buy RDD (today)

RDD availability changes. Use this page as a **safe starting point**.

## Step 1 — Find active markets (aggregators)
These pages list current markets and are the fastest way to see “what’s live” *right now*:

- CoinGecko (RDD): https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/reddcoin
- CoinMarketCap (RDD): https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/redd/
- CoinPaprika (RDD): https://coinpaprika.com/coin/rdd-reddcoin/

## Step 2 — Verify on the exchange
Before you trade, confirm on the exchange UI that:
- deposits are enabled
- withdrawals are enabled
- your jurisdiction / KYC rules are acceptable
- the order book has real depth

## Step 3 — Trade small, then self‑custody
- Send a small test amount first.
- Withdraw to your own wallet after trading.
