# Exchanges

RDD market availability changes over time.

This section is designed to be **honest and practical**:

- Some exchanges list RDD for a period and later remove markets.
- Some sites show RDD “price pages” even when you cannot trade there.
- Some listings are region‑restricted or become illiquid.

## The safest principle

**If you can’t withdraw to your own wallet, you don’t own it.**

See: [Self‑custody and keys](../security/self-custody.md)

## Data sources (aggregators)

Use these as “discovery tools,” then verify on the exchange itself:

- CoinGecko (RDD): https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/reddcoin
- CoinMarketCap (RDD): https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/redd/
- CoinPaprika (RDD): https://coinpaprika.com/coin/rdd-reddcoin/
