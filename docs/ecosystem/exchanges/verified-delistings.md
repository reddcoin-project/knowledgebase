# Verified delistings & removals ledger

This ledger records **primary-source** delistings / removals / withdrawal suspensions related to RDD.

> Goal: preserve history without speculation.
>
> If a row has only community evidence, it belongs in the Reddit index page (not here).

## Ledger

| Platform | Event type | Date (stated) | Source |
|---|---|---:|---|

## Notes

- “Delisted” can mean: market removed, deposits/withdrawals disabled, or asset entirely removed.
- Always verify the platform’s current UI state before sending funds.

If you have an exchange support article (Zendesk / blog / email) confirming a delisting, add it here.
