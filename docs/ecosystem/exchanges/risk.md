# Risk & scam avoidance

ReddCoin is an “old school” Layer‑1 coin. That brings benefits — and also risks when interacting with modern exchange ecosystems.

## Avoid fake listings

Scammers may create fake markets, fake “RDD” tokens, or fake support accounts.

**Red flags**
- “Deposit now” links from random DMs
- no withdrawals available
- brand‑new exchange with no reputation
- unsupported wallet formats or “wrapped” coins that aren’t official

## Verify before you trade

1. Check the exchange’s official market page
2. Verify deposit/withdraw status
3. Send a small test amount first
4. Withdraw to self‑custody immediately after trading

## Why exchanges delist assets

Delistings can happen for many reasons, including low liquidity, compliance changes, or operational support costs.
