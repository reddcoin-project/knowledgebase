# Exchange Safety Checklist

Before trading RDD on any exchange:

1. Confirm deposits AND withdrawals are enabled.
2. Send a small test transaction first.
3. Check real order book depth (not just price).
4. Withdraw to self‑custody immediately after trading.
5. Never trust unsolicited support DMs.

Self‑custody remains the safest long‑term option.
