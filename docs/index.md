## What this site is (and isn’t)

This site is designed to be:

- **Practical**: task-first pages (download, stake, fix, build)
- **Trustworthy**: canonical sources linked, “last verified” notes where applicable
- **Safe**: security warnings and verification steps are consistent sitewide

It is not a marketing site; it’s an operational and technical reference for the community.
