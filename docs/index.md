title: ReddCoin Knowledgebase
---

Welcome, **ReddHeads** — builders, stakers, educators, and supporters helping secure the ReddCoin network.

> **Live since 2014. 100% volunteer-run.** Built on Honesty, Transparency, and Crypto‑Ethics — “old school crypto” with modern usability.

## Faith, Hope, and Charity

ReddCoin is a social currency. The knowledgebase should feel like a community-run library — not a sales funnel.

## What this site is (and isn’t)

This site is designed to be:

- **Practical**: task-first pages (download, stake, fix, build)
- **Trustworthy**: canonical sources linked, “last verified” notes where applicable
- **Safe**: security warnings and verification steps are consistent sitewide

It is not a marketing site; it’s an operational and technical reference for the community.
