title: UI/UX & Information Architecture Review
---

This page records the **senior UI/UX** decisions used to shape this knowledgebase, so changes stay consistent over time.

## Primary audience paths

We optimize for four high-frequency intents:

1. **Download** (official binaries + verification)
2. **Stake** (PoSV v2, ops, expectations)
3. **Troubleshoot** (triage → decision tree → recipes)
4. **Build** (ReddID + namespaces + schema)

These are reflected in both the homepage **Quick Actions** and the **Start Here** portal.

## Design choices (why)

### Quiet authority
Crypto users have high “scam-alert” sensitivity. We therefore prefer a **calm**, high-contrast UI with restrained color and strong typography.

### Accessibility & contrast
We enforce readable header contrast and consistent link emphasis so key actions remain visible in both light and dark modes.

### Separation of concerns
“Ecosystem” is user-facing (products/partners/markets). “Builders” is technical (ReddID/specs/schema). This prevents cognitive overload.

## What to preserve
- Task-first routing and scannable hub pages
- Safety admonitions on security-critical pages
- “Last verified” notes on pages with changing external links

## What to improve next
- Add diagrams for ReddID flows (namespaces → resolution → wallet integration)
- Add a minimal “Network status / advisories” banner when incidents occur
