ReddCoin is volunteer-run. That means the best way to help is to make small improvements consistently — and to keep changes easy for other ReddHeads to review.

## 5‑minute fixes
- Fix typos
- Make a URL clickable
- Add a missing link
- Update “Last verified” dates on external-link pages

## 30‑minute fixes
- Add a troubleshooting recipe (symptom → checks → safe fix)
- Add a “Why we do this” paragraph (ethics + rationale)
- Improve a page layout for readability

## Deep work
- Add or update protocol docs (PoSV v2 / node ops)
- Expand ReddID builder docs (namespaces, schema, implementation)
- Create diagrams (Mermaid) for hard concepts

## Style rules
- Keep tone welcoming and jargon‑free.
- Use **Deep Dive** sections (collapsible) for technical detail.
- Cite canonical sources and link them clearly.
- Prefer safety-first guidance for keys, wallets, and downloads.

## Where changes happen
- Documentation: `docs/`
- Styling: `docs/assets/stylesheets/extra.css`
- JS widgets (interactive guides): `docs/assets/javascripts/`
