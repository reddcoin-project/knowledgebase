# Reddcoin Wiki (legacy MediaWiki)

The historic MediaWiki instance contains valuable operational documentation, but some sections have been affected by spam/polluted edits.

## Recommended approach

- Prefer **permalink (oldid) URLs** when referencing the legacy wiki.
- Treat any page containing unrelated “investment / price prediction / SEO” material as compromised.

## What we extracted into this knowledgebase

See the curated section:

- [Legacy wiki (curated)](../../legacy_wiki/index.md)

It includes wallet recovery, zapwallettxes, Core UI issues, and an exchange directory snapshot — plus an integrity report showing which pages appear compromised.
