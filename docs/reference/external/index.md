# External references (index)

This page centralizes quick outbound links used across the knowledgebase.

## GitHub wiki

# Reddcoin Wiki (legacy MediaWiki)

The historic MediaWiki instance contains valuable operational documentation, but some sections have been affected by spam/polluted edits.

## Recommended approach

- Prefer **permalink (oldid) URLs** when referencing the legacy wiki.
- Treat any page containing unrelated “investment / price prediction / SEO” material as compromised.

## What we extracted into this knowledgebase

See the curated section:

- [Legacy wiki (curated)](../../legacy_wiki/index.md)

It includes wallet recovery, zapwallettxes, Core UI issues, and an exchange directory snapshot — plus an integrity report showing which pages appear compromised.

## Entry points

- Main page: https://wiki.reddcoin.com/
- Exchange directory: https://wiki.reddcoin.com/Exchanges
- Community links hub: https://wiki.reddcoin.com/Community

## CoinGecko

# CoinGecko

CoinGecko provides a public market page for ReddCoin (RDD) including community links, explorers, and market data.

- CoinGecko page: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/reddcoin

## What to use it for (in this knowledgebase)

- A quick directory of third‑party explorers and social links.
- Cross-checking listed tags/metadata.

## What not to treat as canonical

- Live price, market cap, and volume (highly time‑variable).
- Any third‑party links that are not also present in official channels.

## Reddit

# Reddit (r/reddCoin)

- Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/

## What it’s used for

- Community announcements
- Support questions (wallet upgrades, peers, staking)
- Discussion around new infra (e.g., explorers, blockbook, releases)

## Curation notes

Reddit is **not a canonical source** by itself, but it is a valuable feed of:

- what users are experiencing (issues, questions)
- what the team is communicating informally
- what topics are trending inside the community

When this knowledgebase references Reddit, it should:

- link to the specific post/comment thread
- capture the key factual claim and the supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, release tags, etc.)
- avoid treating speculation as fact
