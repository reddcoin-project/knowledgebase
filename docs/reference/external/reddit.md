## Curation notes

Reddit is **not a canonical source** by itself, but it is a valuable feed of:

- what users are experiencing (issues, questions)
- what the team is communicating informally
- what topics are trending inside the community

When this knowledgebase references Reddit, it should:

- link to the specific post/comment thread
- capture the key factual claim and the supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, release tags, etc.)
- avoid treating speculation as fact
