# Telegram export notes (ReddCoinOfficial)

This knowledgebase draws **curated** operational guidance from the public ReddCoin Telegram channel.

## What we used

- Source: public channel/group **ReddCoinOfficial** (`t.me/ReddcoinOfficial`)
- Input material: an exported HTML archive covering ~7 years (Feb 2019 → Feb 2026)
- Focus: **troubleshooting and technical guidance**, especially from:
  - John (cryptognasher) Nash (lead dev)
  - Tech Adept (project leader)
  - Admins/mods such as obito, Kpcrypt0, HPMentjox, and other clearly identified team accounts

## What we did *not* do

To avoid spam and privacy issues, we:

- Do **not** republish large volumes of raw chat logs
- Prefer **admin-authored** guidance when extracting operational procedures
- Remove or avoid quoting:
  - phone numbers, emails, addresses
  - “support” DMs, scammy airdrops, off-topic promotions
  - highly time-bound advice (unless labeled as such)

## How to cite

Where a runbook cites Telegram, it uses the Telegram export’s message id (e.g., `message2035575`) and includes a permalink pattern:

- `https://t.me/ReddcoinOfficial/<message_number>`

If the permalink does not resolve (Telegram can change numbering/visibility), the message id still maps to the stored export.
