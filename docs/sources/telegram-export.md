# Telegram export notes (ReddCoinOfficial)

This knowledgebase draws **curated operational guidance** from the public ReddCoin Telegram channel.

## What we used

- Input material: an exported HTML archive covering **~7 years** (Feb 2019 → Feb 2026).
- Focus: troubleshooting, recovery, wallet operations, and admin-authored advisories.
- We prioritize guidance from clearly identified team/admin accounts, including:
  - John (cryptognasher) Nash (lead dev)
  - Tech Adept (project leader)
  - Admins/mods such as obito, Kpcrypt0, HPMentjox, etc.

## How Telegram is cited in this wiki

When we extract a specific procedure or advisory, we cite it as a footnote in the form:

- `message<id>` + date + author + short excerpt  
- Permalink: `https://t.me/ReddcoinOfficial/<id>`

This keeps the wiki compact while still allowing readers to verify the original context.

## Sanitization / privacy rules

To avoid spam and privacy issues, we do **not** republish large volumes of raw chat logs. In particular:

- We avoid quoting or reproducing personal contact details (phone numbers, emails, addresses).
- We do not include referral spam, scam pitches, or unrelated off-topic chatter.
- When a useful fix comes from a non-admin user, we treat it as **Tier 3** evidence and try to find admin confirmation before promoting it into a runbook.

## Recency and version drift

Telegram guidance can be **time-bound** (e.g., during an active fork incident) and **version-specific** (v3 vs v4). Pages that include operational steps should always declare which wallet line the steps apply to.

If you find advice that is obsolete, open an issue/PR with:
- the message permalink(s)
- the version context
- the proposed correction
