# Roadmap Philosophy

ReddCoin does not operate on hype-driven timelines.

## Our Approach

- Maintain stability before expanding features.
- Improve usability before increasing complexity.
- Preserve decentralization above all else.
- Expand ReddID and tooling thoughtfully.
- Avoid speculative pivots that compromise long-term integrity.

## Why No Traditional VC Roadmap?

ReddCoin is volunteer-run and community-led. 
We prioritize sustainability over marketing cycles.
