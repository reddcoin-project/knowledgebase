# Decentralization & Governance

ReddCoin is not a corporation. It is a volunteer-run Layer-1 blockchain founded in 2014.

## Governance Model

- No venture capital ownership
- No token allocation authority
- No corporate treasury control
- Development coordinated publicly via GitHub

## Decision Flow

1. Community discussion (GitHub / Reddit / Telegram).
2. Technical review.
3. Code implementation.
4. Public release.

## Transparency Principles

- All source code is public.
- Releases are versioned and auditable.
- No hidden governance mechanisms.

ReddCoin survives through distributed responsibility, not centralized command.
