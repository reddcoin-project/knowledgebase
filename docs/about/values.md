title: Project Values & Volunteer Ethos
---

ReddCoin is **100% volunteer‑run** and has been live since **2014**. We’re “old school crypto” on purpose: we prioritize **Honesty, Transparency, and Crypto‑Ethics** over hype, data monetization, or venture capital.

## Faith, Hope, and Charity (why we exist)

ReddCoin’s mission is social-first: bring value back to humanity and genuine interaction — *not* extract it.

## What “volunteer-run” means (set expectations)

- **No paid support desk.** We help each other in public channels.
- **We document decisions.** If a guide says “do X”, it should also say *why*.
- **We ship safely.** Security and self-custody come first.
- **We welcome ReddHeads.** Whether you’re here to tip, stake, or build — you belong here.

- We don’t build dark patterns into wallets or docs.
- We try to make costs, risks, and tradeoffs explicit.
- We prefer open standards and reproducible release artifacts.
