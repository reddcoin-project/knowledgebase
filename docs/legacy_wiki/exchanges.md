# Exchanges

This page is a **curated snapshot** of the most useful portion of the legacy Reddcoin Wiki exchange directory, plus the project’s current Linktree pointers.

**Legacy source:** `wiki.reddcoin.com/Exchanges` permalink `oldid=9186` (last edited on the wiki: 2025‑07‑05).  
**Current pointer list:** `https://linktr.ee/reddcoin` (see “Exchanges” section).

!!! warning "Listings change"
    Treat this as a **starting point**, not a guarantee of availability. Always verify:
    - deposits/withdrawals are enabled,
    - the venue is on the canonical chain,
    - and you can execute a small test transfer.
