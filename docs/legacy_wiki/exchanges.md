# Exchanges (legacy directory)

This page is a **curated snapshot** of the most useful portion of the legacy Reddcoin Wiki exchange directory.

**Source:** `wiki.reddcoin.com/Exchanges` permalink `oldid=9186` (last edited on the wiki: 2025‑07‑05).

## Official “short list” (from Linktree)

These are the exchanges listed on the project Linktree (treat as the most “officially pointed-to” list).

| Exchange | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NonKYC | CEX | Listed on Linktree; verify pairs/fees at the venue |
| StakeCube | CEX | Listed on Linktree; may require account setup |
| FreiExchange | CEX | Listed on Linktree |
| EnnoDigital | CEX | Listed on Linktree |

## Expanded legacy list (from wiki)

> Safety note: The legacy wiki includes commentary like “withdrawals suspended” or “scam” about some venues. Those claims are **community-provided** and may be outdated. Treat them as *unverified notes* and independently verify before use.

| Venue | Type | Pairs / notes (legacy) |
|---|---|---|
| TradeOgre | CEX | RDD/BTC; withdrawal fee and minimum listed on legacy wiki |
| StakeCube | CEX | RDD/SCC; venue runs its own token ecosystem |
| SouthXchange | CEX | RDD/BTC; listed withdrawal fee + minimum on legacy wiki |
| FreiExchange | CEX | RDD/LTC; listed withdrawal fee + minimum on legacy wiki |
| Unnamed.exchange | CEX | RDD/USDT; listed withdrawal fee + minimum on legacy wiki |
| Unnamed.exchange | CEX | RDD/BTC; listed withdrawal fee + minimum on legacy wiki |
| XeggeX | CEX | RDD/USDT; legacy wiki contains negative community notes (unverified) |
| YoBit | CEX | RDD/DOGE + others; legacy wiki contains “withdrawals suspended” note (unverified) |

## What we intentionally did **not** import

The legacy wiki page also contains sections for:

- “Swaps” and “P2P exchanges”
- “Wrapped RDD” experiments and third‑party forms

Those sections are **high variance** and tend to go stale quickly. We link to them from the external wiki reference, but we do not treat them as canonical documentation.
