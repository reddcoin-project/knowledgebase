# Legacy wiki integrity report

This page tracks which `wiki.reddcoin.com` pages appear **clean**, **mixed**, or **compromised** based on quick triage (presence of irrelevant/spam content, marketing injections, or obvious non‑Reddcoin material).

> Notes
> - Status reflects *what we observed at the referenced permalink (oldid)*.
> - “Compromised” does not mean the entire wiki is unsafe — it means that page should not be treated as authoritative until it is cleaned.

## Clean / useful (good candidates for extraction)

- **Exchanges** (legacy exchange directory) — permalink: `oldid=9186`
- **Community** (social links hub) — permalink: `oldid=11308`
- **Community Resources** (community-built apps list) — permalink: `oldid=6905`
- **Reddcoin Core Issues** (known UI issues for Core 3.10.x) — permalink: `oldid=6906`
- **Restore your wallet** — permalink: `oldid=4846`
- **Remove stuck transactions with zapwallettxes** — permalink: `oldid=4783`
- **Update to Reddcoin Core v.3.10.3 on Raspberry Pi** — permalink: `oldid=4704`
- **Getting started** (WIP but helpful entry point) — permalink: `oldid=4829`

## Mixed / needs cleanup (extract cautiously)

- **Social X** — includes at least one irrelevant external link; extract only the intended Reddcoin content and ignore unrelated links.
- **Reddcoin.conf** — contains legacy settings and a non-English note; treat as historical reference.
- **Troubleshooting** — contains outdated exchange and purchasing references (e.g., legacy services). Extract operational wallet guidance only.

## Compromised (do not treat as authoritative)

- **Guides** — contains unrelated, spam-like “investment / price prediction” language and non-Reddcoin material at permalink `oldid=7394`.
- **Technical Information** — heavily polluted with unrelated content (e.g., gold / investment spam) at permalink `oldid=9330`.
