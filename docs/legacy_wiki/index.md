# Legacy wiki extracts

The historic Reddcoin MediaWiki instance (`wiki.reddcoin.com`) contains genuinely useful pages — but it has also suffered from **spam / page pollution** in some sections.

This section provides **curated, safety-minded extracts** of the pieces that remain useful for day-to-day operators (wallet recovery, known UI issues, exchange listings), along with an integrity report that flags compromised pages.

## How we handle polluted content

- We prefer **permalink (oldid) snapshots** of wiki pages to avoid future edits or spam.
- We **do not copy** promotional, suspicious, or unrelated external links.
- When a page mixes good content with questionable claims, we extract the operational steps and label the rest as *unverified / legacy*.

## What belongs here

- Operational “how-to” that still helps today (wallet restore, zapwallettxes).
- Small, factual reference pages (example `reddcoin.conf`).
- Curated exchange directory snapshots, clearly labeled by source + date.
