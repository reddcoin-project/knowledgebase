# Telegram (official community group)

## How to access

The public ReddCoin community group is:

- **ReddCoin | The Social Currency** — https://t.me/ReddcoinOfficial

Open the link in a browser and click **View in Telegram**, or open it directly in the Telegram app (desktop or mobile). The group landing page describes it as the official global community and links back to the official Linktree hub.[^tg-landing]

If you don’t have Telegram installed, the page will prompt you to download or open Telegram Web.[^tg-landing]

## What to trust (and what not to trust)

Telegram is excellent for fast help and community coordination, but it is also a high-risk environment for scams.

**Treat Telegram as Tier 3 (community context).** Anything that changes protocol rules, wallet behavior, or official download locations must be cross-checked with canonical sources (official docs, official site posts, official GitHub releases).

### Safety rules (add to every help reply)

- Admins and team members should **not** ask you to share seed phrases, private keys, or your wallet.dat.
- Be suspicious of unsolicited DMs offering “support”, “recovery”, or “upgrade files”.
- Prefer official domains (reddcoin.com, redd.love, download.reddcoin.com) and official repos.

## How we extract durable knowledge from Telegram

We do **not** attempt to mirror chat logs into the wiki. Instead we extract repeatable, evergreen items:

- Pinned messages and official announcements
- Repeat troubleshooting patterns (symptom → verified fix)
- Links to official resources (downloads, bootstraps, explorers)

### Exporting chat history for review

To do a structured review of Telegram history, use **Telegram Desktop**:

1. Join the group.
2. Open the group chat.
3. Use the menu (⋮) → **Export chat history**.
4. Export as HTML/JSON and attach to a review workflow.

When importing, apply the sanitization rules in [How we curate community sources](triage.md).
