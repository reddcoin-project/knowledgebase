# Reddit (r/reddCoin)

## Access

Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/

Reddit is useful as a searchable archive of “what users actually ran into”, especially around wallet upgrades, forks, sync issues, and staking behavior. It is not canonical: treat it as **Tier 3** and cross-check protocol claims against official docs.

## Curated high-signal threads (examples)

These are included because they repeatedly answer real support problems and contain concrete steps that can be verified.

| Topic | Why it’s useful | Link | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Corrupted block database / v3 → v4 upgrade | Clear, step-by-step “clean install” guidance and bootstrap notes; also documents the risk of syncing onto a wrong fork without bootstrap | https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/1gznin7/corrupted_block_database_detected/ | Plausible (verify against official v4 notes) |
| v4.22.9 wallet update announcement | Community-facing summary and download pointer (still verify official download domain) | https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/1cwnncv/reddcoin_4229_wallet_update_may_20_2024/ | Historical |

## How to search effectively

- Prefer “site search” from a general search engine:
  - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin corrupted block database`
  - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin bootstrap`
  - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin 4.22.9`
- Sort by **Top** when looking for durable explanations; sort by **New** for current incident reports.

## Sanitization notes

When importing Reddit information into the wiki:

- Never embed screenshots that show private keys, full addresses, or balances.
- Replace non-official download links with official equivalents where possible.
- Prefer summarizing “symptom → verified fix” and link the thread for full context.
