# Reddit (r/reddCoin) — curated entry points

Reddit is a high-signal source for **real user reports** (what broke, how it was fixed), but it also accumulates stale advice across wallet eras.

!!! warning "Version drift"
    Always note the post date and the wallet version discussed. If you’re on modern Core v4, prioritize posts from 2024+ unless you are specifically researching legacy behavior.

## Where to start

- Subreddit home: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/
- Sort by “Top” (year / all time) to find historical context; sort by “New” for current issues.

## How we use Reddit in this knowledgebase

We treat Reddit threads as **Tier 2/3** evidence:

- Tier 1: official releases, official downloads, official docs
- Tier 2: admin-authored public guidance (Telegram / dev posts)
- Tier 3: community troubleshooting threads (Reddit / forums)

When a Reddit fix is included as a runbook step, we try to find an admin confirmation or a modern release note to support it.
