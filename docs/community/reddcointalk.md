## How we use it in the wiki

- **Index and summarize**: capture the durable point in 1–3 sentences and link the thread.
- **Prefer canonical docs for rules**: staking and consensus rules come from the official docs and Core releases.
- **Strip risk**: remove wallet addresses, binaries, and any “DM for support” patterns.

## Spam/pollution posture

Older forums can accumulate outdated guides and risky links. For any thread that includes downloads or “tooling”, prefer official equivalents (official download domain or official GitHub repos) and mark the thread as *Historical* unless recently verified.
