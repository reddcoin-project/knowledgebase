# ReddcoinTalk forum (reddcointalk.org) — curated legacy archive

ReddcoinTalk contains many years of troubleshooting, but most of it predates modern Core v4. Use it mainly as a **legacy archive** and verify applicability.

- Forum home: https://reddcointalk.org/

!!! warning "Legacy by default"
    Assume most ReddcoinTalk advice is **v2/v3-era** unless the thread explicitly references v4.22.x.

## Curated threads worth bookmarking (legacy)

### Repair flags / transactions

- `zapwallettxes` how-to (legacy):  
  https://reddcointalk.org/t/solved-zapwallettxes-how-to/521

### Bootstrap

- “Bootstrap.dat ?” (legacy thread):  
  https://reddcointalk.org/t/bootstrap-dat/556  
  (Useful mainly to understand historical bootstrap methods; v4 uses different packaging—see **[Bootstrap](../using/troubleshooting/bootstrap.md)**.)

## How we incorporate forum content

We **do not** copy entire threads into the wiki. Instead we:

1. Extract the *repeatable steps* (if still valid)
2. Add a “**Applies to**” banner (v2/v3/v4)
3. Link back to the original thread

If you spot a forum post that is still uniquely valuable for v4, open a PR with the link and a short summary.
