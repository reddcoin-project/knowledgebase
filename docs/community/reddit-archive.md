# Reddit archive and community intelligence (r/reddCoin)

ReddCoin has years of community context on Reddit. We treat this as a **secondary source** (community memory), and we link back to canonical docs whenever possible.

## High-signal links (curated)
- Tipbot on Twitter guide (subreddit wiki): https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/tipbot_twitter/
- Tipbot on Twitch guide (subreddit wiki): https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/wiki/tipbot_twitch/
- ReddID name cost calculator announcement: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/8ma7f3/reddcoin_core_reddid_name_cost_calculator/
- ReddCoin Summary (2023 Year in Review): https://www.reddit.com/r/reddCoin/comments/18zrlh2/reddcoin_summary_2023_year_in_review_and_a_bit_of/

## Datamining workflow (for volunteers)
1. Use Reddit search or Google with:
   - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin tipbot`
   - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin staking`
   - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin reddid`
   - `site:reddit.com/r/reddCoin core 4.22`
2. Extract:
   - the durable question
   - the best canonical answer (GitHub wiki / reddcoin.com / redd.love)
   - operational tips that are still valid
3. Add the thread link to a relevant knowledgebase page under **Community context**.
4. Avoid copying long text. Prefer summaries + links.

!!! note "Ethics and transparency"
    Reddit is community memory, not an official spec. Prefer canonical sources for technical truth.

## Backlog topics to mine
- Wallet sync issues and known fixes
- Exchange deposit/withdraw delays (chain verification steps)
- Tipping adoption and platform commands
- Staking misconceptions (“why no rewards?”)
- ReddID and namespaces cost questions
