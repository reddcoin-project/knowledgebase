# Roadmap / backlog

This is a living backlog for expanding the **ReddCoin Knowledgebase** (this site), not the ReddCoin protocol itself.

## Recently completed

- Added **News & Updates** section with curated links to official blog, Medium, and release posts.
- Added **Troubleshooting decision tree** and a **Getting help** page with safe templates.
- Added **Wallet files & locations** reference page for non-technical backups and recovery.
- Bridged the **incident log** to specific runbooks where possible.
- Updated **Markets & exchanges** with official exchange advisories (e.g. Xeggex closure notice) and reminders about self-custody.
- Expanded community links to include newer official channels (e.g., Bluesky) when published by the project.

## Next priorities (content)

1. **Exchange matrix refresh (curated)**
   - Rebuild the legacy wiki exchange table as a maintained page here (with "last verified" dates).
   - Separate "trading pairs" from "deposits/withdrawals" status.
   - Add official advisories and known outages.

2. **Core wallet documentation hardening
   - Expand version-specific pages for v3 vs v4 (data directory differences, seed phrase vs wallet.dat behavior, multi-wallet).
   - Add a dedicated page for "How to verify you are on the canonical chain" (blockhash checks + explorer cross-check).

3. **ReddID / Project Redd consolidation
   - Bring in the current ReddID repos, implementation status, and “how to participate” guidance.
   - Add a short glossary for terms used across ReddBook/ReddPaper.

4. **Explorer & API reference expansion
   - Document the Blockbook endpoints we rely on (supply, peers, address/tx lookups).
   - Add examples for common developer tasks.

## Governance rules

- Protocol / wallet rules should link to a **primary source** (ReddPaper/ReddBook, code, release note, or official announcement).
- Community-source advice (Telegram/Reddit) is welcome but should be labeled as:
  - Confirmed / Plausible / Historical / Unverified
  - ...and ideally include a “Last reviewed” stamp.
- For time-sensitive topics (exchanges, releases, outages), avoid hardcoding “latest” claims; link to the authoritative upstream index.


## Newly completed (v0.14 — 2026-02-13)

- Implemented **brand styling** (palette + CSS) and added **Branding & usage guidelines**.
- Added **Canonical chain verification** reference page.
- Rebuilt the **Exchanges & markets** page into a maintainable matrix with Last verified.
- Added a **Knowledgebase changelog** (on-site + root file).
