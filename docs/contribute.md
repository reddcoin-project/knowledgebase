# How to contribute

## Ways to help

- Fix factual errors (with sources)
- Add missing pages (wallet setup, staking troubleshooting, explorers, integrations)
- Keep external references current (exchanges, explorers, aggregators)
- Improve diagrams and architecture explanations

## Style guide (short)

- Prefer primary sources (official docs, GitHub, explorer data)
- Separate **facts** from **opinions**
- Put a “Sources” section at the end of every page
