# Start Here

Welcome, **ReddHeads**. This knowledgebase is a community-run library for a volunteer, first‑generation Layer‑1 blockchain founded in 2014.

ReddCoin exists to help people share value online — ethically, transparently, and without corporate gatekeepers. Our mission is **Faith, Hope, and Charity**: a social currency that prioritizes people over hype.
