## FAQs

# FAQs (starter)

## Is PoSV v2 a hard fork?

Yes. Wallet upgrades are required to remain on the correct chain after activation.

## Will PoSV v2 change block time?

No — block time remains ~60 seconds; staking reward logic changes.

## Can I stake from an exchange?

Not directly. Staking is performed by wallets that are online and participating; custodial services may offer staking on your behalf, with tradeoffs.
